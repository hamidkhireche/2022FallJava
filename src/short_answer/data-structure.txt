When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:To store a set of ﬁxed key words which are referenced very frequently

What is an Array? is a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type
Answer: and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations


What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class

What is a LinkedList?
Answer:

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer:a linked list is made up of nodes

What is a Queue?
 represents an ordered list of elements.

What is a Stack (referring to data structures)?
Answer:a linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer:The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method assumes that the last unit to arrive in inventory or more recent is sold first.
       The First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method assumes that the oldest unit of inventory is the sold first.

Explain Big O Notation?
is the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer:Sequential search

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer:a collection of nodes

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer:

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: HashMap is non-synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer:provides the functionality of the hash table data structure

Image result for what is hashmap in java how they store value
A HashMap stores data into multiple singly linked lists of entries

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: is one of the most common errors in Java
It occurs when a program attempts to access an invalid index in an array
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer:Iterating each element of the given original array and copy one element at a time.
       Using clone() method.
       Using arraycopy() method.
       Using copyOf() method of Arrays class.
       Using copyOfRange() method of Arrays class.

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer:BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path.
       DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure

What is Recursion?
Answer:This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems
which are easier to solve

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer:In a linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other sequentially.
A user can transverse each element through a single run.
In a non-linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other hierarchically

Outline different sorting algorithms and their time complexities:
· Best Time Complexity: Define the input for which algorithm takes less time or minimum time.
